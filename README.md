## Description

The app allows you to record your voice, and then on the next screen adjust the pitch and play the sound back at a different pitch using a slider.  The challenge is to persist the last location of the slider so that it is in the same position (and performs the same pitch adjustment) the next time the app is opened.

## Purpose

This a Udacity iOS Nanodegree course challenge.  It is the first challenge app in the persistence course.  The purpose of the app is to get to know how to persist data using UserDefaults.

## Contributing

This app is specific to Udacity's Nanodegree course, and doesn't require contributions.  For non-Udacity students who are learning about persistence, feel free to look at the code.
